# JIG
Program to calculate the probable number of pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Usually puzzles have slightly more pieces than advertised to get better piece ratios (they look more like squares). For example a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle with a 16/9 image in it would be at best 40/25 and the pieces would have ratio of 1,11111... But with just 8 more pieces it is possible to make a 42/24 puzzle with a piece ratio of 0.98, almost a perfect square. JIG is designed so it finds this piece increments that lead to much better puzzles.
